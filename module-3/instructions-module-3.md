# Workshop Module 3 - Keep code clean and readable

In this workshop, we will review a Pull Request and then debug the code.

Note: This code is the solution to the 2021 Advent of Code, day 1.

## 1 - Code review

- What are some obvious formatting mistakes ?
- Is the code easy to understand ? 

## 2 - Debug

- It seems there's a bug. The code should increase the counter any time a value is higher than the previous one.
- Find the mistake !
